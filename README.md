#### No longer working on
Originally, I was attempting to build a multiplayer casual game on the browser, eventually for mobile phone but I simply changed my mind in the middle, realizing that the motivation to play might not be great enough.

#### Thoughts out of it

- learned phaser
- have a general idea of what is needed to make it run in multiplayer with websockets (initial plan was to get people to play with bots, otherwise it would never build up)
- i like this gulp, coffeescript, and browserify boilerplate for anything on the clientside. it definitely simplified things a lot more for me
